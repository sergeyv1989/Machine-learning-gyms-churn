# Gym's churn rate research

In this project I will research the churn rate of customers of a gym chain.

The data is compiled from a log of information about the gym customers for a period of a month. It contains their properties, visits and purchases, and their membership status at the end of the month.

The end goal is to advise the gym chain on how to work with the customers to decrease the churn rate.

The main steps of the project will be:
- Loading the data.
- Preparing the data for analysis by discovering and treating issues.
- Exploring the data to learn its contents.
- Building a model to predict user churn.
- Creating user clusters.
- Drawing conclusions and formulating recommendations regarding the strategy for customer interaction and retention.
